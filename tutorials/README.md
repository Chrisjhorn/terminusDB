# Tutorials
The tutorials each are a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/),  so that you can interactively run the Python yourself as you read through the text.

If you don't have Jupyter,  then there is also a `.html` file containing the full tutorial, including the results of running each code segment. Git won't display the .html file directly, so download it and then use your browser to view the download.

I hope in due course to do a series of tutorials.  Right now,  there is just:
* `Tutorial 1` - getting started with TerminusDB

`Tutorial2` is work in progress, and incomplete. It will be a tutorial on handling .csv files once I finish it..
