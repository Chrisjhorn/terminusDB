This tutorial describes how to load .csv files (locally, or over the internet) into TerminusDB.

It assumes you have at least a basic working knowledge of Python 3, including knowing how to download and install standard modules;  and that you have taken a look at Tutorial 1.

As the tutorial proceeds, there are screen shots of what you should see in your TerminusDB console.

The tutorial brings you through:

* Loading a raw .csv file into memory (locally, or over the internet)
* Generating TerminusDB documents (typically, one per row of your .csv file)
* Initialising the properties of each new document
* Inserting the new documents into TerminusDB
* Examining the documents, and cleaning up any rogue data

I've noticed that the .html file here is not a completely faithful capture of what the Jupyter Notebook displays,  and has some formatting issues.  It was created using the `download` converter in the Notebook.  I'll have to go in manually and clean up the generated .html,  I'll do this when I get a few minutes..  Apologies.

Please let me know of any issues with the tutorial code!.. You can reach me on the TerminusDB discord server.
