# Tutorials
The swoql tutorials here are:
* Tutorial_1 - uses an in-memory set of data to build a new TerminusDB database, and queries it
* Tutorial_2 - uses an external .csv file (on the web) to build a new TerminusDB database, and queries it
* Tutorial_3 - a swoql version of the 'bike tutorial', as appears in the standard Javascript and Python distributions.
