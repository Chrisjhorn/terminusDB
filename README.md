# TerminusDB
Some contributed demo and tutorial software to the [TerminusDB](https://terminusdb.com/) open source graph base.

## Tutorials
So far,  I only have four:
* `charities` -- an example of an M:N relationship schema,  using public data about registered Irish charities.
* `family-tree` -- an example of using composable subqueries,  using an external .csv file as raw data
* `family-tree-2` -- another version of `family-tree` which uses in-memory structures to initialise the database,  rather than an external .csv file
* `shipping` -- an animation of maritime traffic at Dublin port, using ephemeral events
